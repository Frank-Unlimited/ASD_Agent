做一个动作，宝宝说出相应的动词，并作连词应答。如妈妈做“抱”的动作，宝宝说：“抱，抱娃娃。”妈妈接着说：“抱，抱西瓜。”宝宝可说：“抱，抱被子”……爸爸也可以参与进来，能连出来的词组越多越好。\n\n6.咕噜\n\n目标：学习使用量词组词和即兴说话，培养思维的准确性和敏捷性。\n\n方法：爸爸和宝宝面对面，双手握空拳，两拳上下交错一边绕圈一边念：“咕噜咕噜1（出示一个手指头）”，爸爸说：“一头牛”。两人再绕圈并念：“咕噜咕噜2（出示两个手指头）”，宝宝说：“两只鸟”。依次说数字组词到10。游戏重新开始。\n\n7.听完跟我说（语音游戏）\n\n游戏目的：幼儿通过倾听成人的发音后，学习简单、正确的发音。\n\n游戏准备：幼儿日常不能准确表达的发音如吃、刺、扎、砸、找、糯等；幼儿喜欢的小贴画若干。\n\n游戏玩法： 幼儿与家长面对面坐着，先听家长说完再复述重复的单音，发音准确一个单音（词）给1枚小贴画鼓励，获得5枚小贴画后得到一个拥抱。\n\n游戏规则：\n\n（1）家长说的必须是幼儿日常发音不太准确的单音。\n\n（2）幼儿说对了给小贴画鼓励，发音不准确不给小贴画。\n\n（3）游戏时间不超过10分钟。\n\n8.彩虹陀螺（语音游戏）\n\n游戏目的：幼儿能按游戏规则说出彩虹陀螺的不同颜色。\n\n游戏准备：打印一张有红、黄、蓝、橙、紫、绿、粉、灰、褐等颜色的彩虹陀螺平面图片，牙签一根，将平面图和牙签组合自制成简易彩虹陀螺；计分牌或计数小棍。\n\n游戏玩法：幼儿先认识彩虹陀螺上面各种颜色，游戏开始后先由一方旋转陀螺，当陀螺停下来后，另一方快速、清楚地说出接触地面的颜色，发音准确且颜色全对的得1分，最先获得20分的人为胜利。\n\n游戏规则：\n\n游戏开始，由失败方先旋转陀螺，胜利方先说陀螺的颜色。\n\n游戏时双方按照轮流的方式进行游戏。\n\n陀螺的颜色必须口吃清楚、快速地表达，不能停顿。如：红、黄、蓝。\n\n9.水果蹲（词汇游戏）\n\n游戏目的：幼儿能按规则说出自己认识的水果名称。\n\n游戏准备：各种幼儿常见的水果图片。\n\n游戏玩法：家长介绍游戏名称“水果蹲”后示范一边原地下蹲一边看图说水果的名称。第一遍游戏家长负责出示图片，幼儿负责原地下蹲并说出水果的名称，一分钟能将所有的水果名称说完算胜利，家长给予拥抱鼓励。第二遍将所有水果图片贴在固定墙面，家长和幼儿轮流水果蹲，看谁说的水果多。\n\n游戏规\n######################\nOutput:",
