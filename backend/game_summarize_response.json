    "overall_assessment": "本次音乐探索游戏取得显著成功，充分验证了辰辰对音乐玩具的强烈内在兴趣。孩子在启动后数秒内即主动转头、靠近、触摸并操作音乐盒，全程情绪愉悦、专注稳定，展现出高度的感官动机与自主探索能力。尤为宝贵的是，他自发聚焦于音乐盒内部的旋转机械结构——这一‘意外发现’不仅拓展了我们对其兴趣图谱的理解（从泛化‘音乐’升维至‘auditory-triggered motion’），更揭示了其对可预测动态视觉刺激的深层偏好。尽管本次未出现与家长的眼神互动，但所有行为均指向功能性社交意图（如通过操作获取声音、通过注视理解因果），为后续嵌入共同注意和眼神联结提供了坚实锚点。整体表现远超基线预期，是一次高动机、低压力、强反馈的优质地板时光。",

No adult-directed gaze shifts occurred, so true triadic joint attention (adult–object–adult) was not yet present.",

      "[20:43] Successful button press followed by genuine smile — confirms operant learning and positive emotional association with cause-effect",
      "[20:43] Sustained visual fixation on rotating mechanism — reveals deep attention to predictable motion patterns, a core ASD sensory strength",
      "[20:43] Brief glance at colored blocks *without* disengaging — shows ability to maintain primary focus amid competing stimuli (early attention regulation)"
