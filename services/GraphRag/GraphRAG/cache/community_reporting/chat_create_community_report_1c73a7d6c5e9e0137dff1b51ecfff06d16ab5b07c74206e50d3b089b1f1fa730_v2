Her role encompasses multiple responsibilities including preparing game props, explaining rules, giving clear instructions, encouraging and helping children, and actively participating in various language development games. She functions as the main adult role in interactions, leading activities in games like '教小猴子' (teaching little monkey) and '捉迷藏' (hide and seek), and in the '小主持人' (little host) game, she records children's speech for playback to aid language development. Additionally, she teaches children about family through imitation exercises and promotes social interaction. While she independently guides children, she also follows the father's instructions and participates in activities together with children to complete educational games and tasks beneficial to child development.

'看六面画' (Looking at Six-Sided Pictures) is designed to develop babies' observation and memory skills using a cube box with six different pictures. The mother familiarizes the baby with the pictures through a 'magic trick' method and then instructs the baby to find specified pictures. '吃到了什么？' (What Did You Eat?) aims to train babies' taste perception, enrich sensory experience, and develop observation skills. In this game, various fruits are cut into small pieces, the baby's eyes are covered, and the baby tastes and names the fruits, with later stages using more similar foods to increase difficulty. Both games demonstrate structured educational approaches with clear pedagogical objectives.

In each relationship, the mother serves as the active organizer and guide: she uses the sofa during games, organizes and guides the '看六面画' game by preparing props and explaining rules, and similarly organizes and guides the '吃到了什么？' game by preparing food, covering the baby's eyes, and guiding taste identification.

Observation and memory skills are targeted through the '看六面画' game using visual recognition tasks.
