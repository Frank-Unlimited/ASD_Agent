宝扮演天气预报员。家长问：“今天天气怎么样”，天气预报员随意转动转盘，并作出相应的动作（晴天：做高兴玩乐的样子，阴天：做快步走的样子，刮风：做东倒西歪的样子，下雨：做要打伞的样子；下雪：做出要滑雪的样子）。\n\n③ 家长可以和宝宝交换角色继续游戏。家长还可以随意做动作，让宝宝猜猜是什么天气。\n\n温馨提示：家长平时也可以和孩子一起看天气预报节目，让宝宝从节目中慢慢熟悉各种专业词语，比如气温、湿度、风向等，还有一些天气符号，也可以让宝宝记住各地地名，并学着解说员播报各地地名和天气情况。\n\n5.宝宝买蔬菜\n\n技能目标：发挥宝宝的想象力，让宝宝在情境游戏中快乐地识字，提高宝宝的语言表达能力。\n\n具体操作：家长扮演卖菜人，反复吆喝着“卖菜了，卖菜了，新鲜的蔬菜，快来买啊。”宝宝扮演买菜的人，挎着小篮子走过来问：“我想要买西红柿、胡萝卜和茄子。”然后把小篮子推到家长那里，家长一边装字卡，一边读出上面的字。宝宝核对篮子里面的字卡，看看家长有没有拿错。宝宝再用同样的方式把其他的蔬菜“买”完。\n\n温馨提示：家长也可以用其他类别的字卡来玩这个游戏，直到宝宝熟悉了字卡上的字为止。如果游戏过程中宝宝读错了字，家长要记得及时纠正。\n\n6.小小主持人\n\n准备：话筒（玩具话筒），录音机，全家人都在场\n\n目的：锻炼孩子的语言表达力和随机应变能力\n\n游戏方法：在家庭当中准备一些小型的节目，让孩子拿话筒学做主持人，可以让孩子先准备好开场白，宣布节目开始。比如为什么要开展这个节目，为谁开展等。妈妈还可以用录音机把孩子讲的话录下来，回头播放给孩子听。这个游戏可以每周玩一次，可以不要每次都让孩子当主持人，而是家庭成员轮流当。也可以以家庭会议的形式进行，由孩子主持家庭会议。\n\n7.猜谜语\n\n准备：谜语卡片\n\n目的：锻炼孩子的思维能力和语言表达力\n\n游戏方法：家长先说一些简单的谜语，比如“脱下红黄衣，七八个兄弟，仅仅抱一起，酸甜各有味，大家都喜欢。（橘子）”让孩子猜谜语。猜的过程中，家长可以继续给出一些语言的提示，或用图片等进行提示，直到孩子猜出正确答案。孩子猜完知道谜底之后，家长可以继续教他把谜面背下来并鼓励他去找其他人猜谜语。\n\n8.看图说故事\n\n准备：安静的环境，纸和笔\n\n目的：锻炼孩子的观察力、注意力，提升孩子的想象力和语言表达力\n\n游戏方法：家长先画出几�\n######################\nOutput:",
