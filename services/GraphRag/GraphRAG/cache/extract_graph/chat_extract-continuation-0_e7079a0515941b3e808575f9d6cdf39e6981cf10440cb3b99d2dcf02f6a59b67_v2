Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also

�、茶叶、樟脑丸、苹果等。蒙上宝宝的眼睛，把准备好的东西一一放在宝宝的鼻子底下，让他闻一闻以后，分辨这些气味，说出都是什么东西。\n\n提示：在做这个游戏前，妈妈先想一想，宝宝平日里有没有闻这些气味的经历，如果没有，就必须先补上这一课。在日常生活中，凡是有气味的东西，都应该有意识地让宝宝闻一闻，并告诉宝宝，这种气味的特点是什么，这能极大地丰富宝宝的感性经验，提高他的认知能力。\n\n5. 想想像什么\n\n目标：发展想象力和创造力。\n\n方法：先让宝宝画一个圆圈，然后问：“宝宝画的是什么？”让宝宝充分想象，类似的事物说得越多越好。如“皮球”、“饼干”、“镜子”、“盖子”、“太阳”等等。爸爸画出一个三角形或其他形状，再问宝宝像什么。\n\n提示：如果可能的话，爸爸妈妈最好在宝宝想象的基础上，给这些图形添画，如圆形上添上绳子为气球，添上光芒即为太阳，添上五官即为脸形，等等。这样可以进一步提高宝宝的游戏积极性，激发他的想象力和创造力。\n\n6. 看看有些什么\n\n目标：培养观察力和记忆力。\n\n方法：拿出三四件宝宝熟悉的玩具，把它们排列在桌子上。让宝宝看看桌上有些什么，接着妈妈用一块大毛巾把玩具盖住，然后再问宝宝：“桌上有些什么玩具？”让宝宝根据记忆说出玩具的名称。\n\n提示：如果宝宝可以的话，还可以要求宝宝按顺序说出玩具的名称，这样宝宝不仅要记住物品的名称，还要记住物品间的排列顺序，游戏难度就增大了。随着宝宝观察记忆力的增长，可以不断增加物品的品种和数量。\n\n7. 玩色块\n\n目标：学习认识各种颜色，发展颜色辨别能力，培养观察力。\n\n方法：找一些正方形的硬纸块，贴上或涂上红、黄、绿、蓝、咖啡、黑、白、灰、紫、粉红等多种颜色，每种颜色准备两个色块。将这些色块混合后两成两份，一人拿一份。妈妈拿出一张色块问宝宝：“你有这种蓝颜色的吗？”或“请给我一张红色的”请宝宝通过对比和分辨这些色块，把颜色相同的色块找到一起。\n\n提示：通过玩色块游戏，能使儿童学会命名颜色，给颜色配对，提高颜色的类分能力。这种游戏的难度主要来源于颜色的差异。颜色差异越大，游戏就越容易，颜色差异越小，游戏的难度就越大。\n\n8. 看六面画\n\n目标：发展观察力和记忆力。\n\n方法：找一个空化妆品盒子（立方体），每面贴上不同的画面，如六种小动物。妈妈用手掌遮住立方体，嘴里说出一个画面的动物名称\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>妈妈<|>PERSON<|>A
